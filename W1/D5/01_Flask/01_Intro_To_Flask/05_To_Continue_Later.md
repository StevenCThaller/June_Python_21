# For This Afternoon

This afternoon, we will look at how we can use `flask` to not only render `HTML` files at any route we choose, but also, how can we modify the contents of that `HTML` without any `javascript`, so that if we went to 12 different routes, the same page might look 12 different ways.

Also, we'll link static files. But that's like 2 seconds.
