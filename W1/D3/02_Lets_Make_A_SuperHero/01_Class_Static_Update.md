# Addressing a Comment I Made Earlier About Class and Static Methods

This morning, I made a whole stink about `Class Methods` and `Static Methods` not being something you'd necessarily need to use at any point in this stack. **I WAS WRONG**. When you get to incorporating your database, and sending/retrieving data to/from the database, it's actually going to be done using `Class Methods`. And validating our data prior to adding it to the database will be done via `Static Methods`.
