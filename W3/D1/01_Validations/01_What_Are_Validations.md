# What are Validations?

Think about the last time you went to create an account. You probably went to some website, and entered your user information. Then, suddenly, after submitting the form, you get some red text saying your password isn't secure enough. It needs to be at least 8 characters long, contain at least letters and numbers, etc.

These are validations. They are crucial to properly functioning web applications. If our data isn't valid, our application isn't valid.
